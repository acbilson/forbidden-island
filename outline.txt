Board

prints the board
  a. randomizes the tiles
  b. places the players

(brief pause before the first cards are drawn)

draws the first six cards
marks those cards as sunken
refresh the board

main loop:

  take first player in stack

  flash cursor position (cursor will start at player position)

  event loop of some kind, waiting for user input
  check for exit ('Q' or <ESC>) 
  sets input to a message type
    types of message: 
      move cursor (arrow keys)
      player action ('M' for move, etc)

  notify observers when an event occurs

events:

  Q: Who registers for these console messages?
  if a console message:

    OnPlayerMove
      is legal move?
      update tiles

Flow:
          Hit 'M' Key
               |
          Sends input to Bus (can I capture index?)
               |
          Bus determines it's a MoveMessage
          ... and sends to registered observers
               |
          Island determines if move is valid
          If yes -> update board tiles
                    update player index
          If no ->  sends error message - can't move there
               |
          Updates player action counter to one less

PlayerCommandFlow:

  current player calls move('up' command, newTile)
    - checks this against currentTile to see if moving up is valid; sets currentTile = returnedTile
      - calls command['move'].execute('up' command, newTile, self.tiles); returns returnedTile
        - calls receiver.action('up' command, newTile, tiles); returns returnedTile
